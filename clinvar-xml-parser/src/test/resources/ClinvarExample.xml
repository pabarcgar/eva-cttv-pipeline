        <Attribute Type="Description">Yamano et al. (1990) found a variant allele of the CYP2A6 gene that has a single amino acid substitution (leu160 to his; L160H) and encodes an unstable and catalytically inactive enzyme. PCR-based diagnostic analysis of DNA from subjects that had been phenotyped for coumarin 7-hydroxylation verified that the variant-1 allele is unable to produce a catalytically active enzyme. Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) found a frequency of 15% for the variant-1 (v1) allele in Finns, with no alleles of the v2 (122720.0004) type. In African Americans, no examples of the CYP2A6 v1 allele was found among 40 alleles; the frequency of the v2 allele was 2.5%. Japanese had 20% v1 allele and 28% v2 allele. Taiwanese had 11% v1 allele, and 6% v2 allele. If both the v1 and v2 alleles encode a catalytically defective enzyme, the Japanese population would be predicted to have a frequency of up to 10% of poor metabolizers of coumarin (122700).</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Hadidi et al. (1997) identified an individual who was homozygous for the L160H substitution. On administration of coumarin (2 mg orally), no detectable 7-hydroxycoumarin was excreted in the urine; rather, approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, the end product of coumarin 3-hydroxylation. His immediate family members who were heterozygous for the CYP2A6*2 allele excreted little 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and mainly 7-hydroxycoumarin, when similarly tested. The authors suggested that persons homozygous for the CYP2A6*2 allele may constitute 1 to 25% of various populations.</Attribute>

They described an allele-specific PCR genotyping method that identified the major defective CYP2A6 allele and accurately predicted the phenotype. An allele frequency of 1 to 3% for CYP2A6*2 was observed in Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish populations, much lower than described previously. In a Chinese population, Oscarson et al.

        <Attribute Type="Description">Following up on the report by Pianezza et al. (1998), London et al. (1999) examined the association between the presence of a single CYP2A6 reduced activity allele (L160H) and lower prevalence of smoking among 460 persons enrolled in a case-control study of lung cancer in Los Angeles County, California. Compared with subjects without a reduced activity allele, those with 2 reduced activity alleles were slightly overrepresented among those who had never smoked (p = 0.057). However, in contrast to the finding of Pianezza et al. (1998), participants with a single reduced activity allele were not less likely to smoke. Furthermore, London et al. (1999) found no evidence that the presence of reduced activity alleles decreased the usual number of cigarettes consumed per day by smokers.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Gu et al. (2000) used long PCR followed by nested PCR to determine 3 CYP2A6 alleles (160L, 160H, and O). Adopting an approach to association analysis originally developed to deal with null alleles implicit in ABO blood group phenotyping, they tested the contribution of 160H (functionally null) to reduced smoking habit, unconfounded by alleles null to the long PCR. The most significant findings (p less than 0.01) were that the possession of a 160H allele, compared with not possessing a 160H allele, was associated with a mean age of starting regular smoking 3 years later; and that the average likelihood of quitting smoking at any time is 1.75 times greater for those possessing a 160H allele compared with those who had no 160H allele. This suggested that a smoking subject with a genotype predicted to confer 50% of the ability to eliminate nicotine via the CYP2A6 pathway has almost twice the likelihood of quitting smoking.</Attribute>

      <Comment>The c.1182+1 G&gt;A splice site mutation in the ACADVL gene has been previously reported in association with VLCAD deficiency (Strauss et al., 2012). This mutation destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 11, and is expected to cause abnormal gene splicing. The variant is found in ACADVL panel(s).</Comment>

          <Attribute Type="public definition">Primary autosomal recessive microcephalies (MCPH) and Seckel syndrome (SCKS) spectrum disorders are characterized by microcephaly and the absence of visceral malformations. Although MCHP and SCKS were previously distinguished by height (maximum height in SCKS was equivalent to the minimum height in MCPH), stature is no longer a discriminating feature, leading to the conclusion that these phenotypes constitute a spectrum rather than distinct entities. Microcephaly is characterized by: Onset during the second trimester of gestation; Occipito-frontal head circumference (OFC) at birth equal to or less than -2 SD below the mean for sex, age, and ethnicity; Slower than average increase in OFC after birth. Variable findings in the MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders include: Brain structure (which is normal in the majority); Degree of cognitive impairment (usually mild to moderate without significant motor delay in the majority of persons with MCPH and more severe in those with SCKS and MCPH with brain malformations); Degree of short stature; Craniosynostosis (which may be secondary to poor brain growth).</Attribute>

          <Attribute Type="public definition">Citrin deficiency can manifest in newborns as neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD), in older children as failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD), and in adults as recurrent hyperammonemia with neuropsychiatric symptoms in citrullinemia type II (CTLN2). Often citrin deficiency is characterized by fondness for protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods and aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. taba: NICCD. Children younger than age one year have growth retardation with transient intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatomegaly, diffuse fatty liver, and parenchymal cellular infiltration associated with hepatic fibrosis, variable liver dysfunction, hypoproteinemia, decreased coagulation factors, hemolytic anemia, and/or hypoglycemia. Although NICCD is generally not severe and symptoms often resolve by age one year with appropriate treatment, some infants succumb to infection and liver cirrhosis and others require liver transplantation. FTTDCD. Around age one to two years, many children with citrin deficiency develop the food preferences mentioned. Some have growth retardation, hypoglycemia, and fatigue as well as hyperlipidemia, pancreatitis, fatty liver, and hepatoma. One or more decades later, some individuals with NICCD or FTTDCD develop CTLN2. CTLN2. Onset is sudden and usually between ages 11 and 79 years. Manifestations are recurrent hyperammonemia with neuropsychiatric symptoms including nocturnal delirium, aggression, irritability, hyperactivity, delusions, disorientation, restlessness, drowsiness, loss of memory, flapping tremor, convulsive seizures, and coma; death can result from brain edema. Symptoms are often provoked by alcohol and sugar intake, medication, and/or surgery. Affected individuals may or may not have a prior history of NICCD or FTTDCD.</Attribute>
